# MCP server spec (#251, from #163)

Status: spec, no code. Lets an AI agent play AB-ALONE through the Model Context Protocol (MCP): a game against the bot, a boss fight, or an online room.

## 1. Decisions (from the last comment of #163)

1. The server is a **local stdio process**. Free. No hosted server before open beta (#74).
2. Online rooms: **embed the P2P client in Node** (Trystero with a WebRTC polyfill). No browser driving. Owner's choice.
3. The agent has **its own Ed25519 key and a seat** like any peer (#117).
4. Agent players are flagged with an **`agent` field in the signed `Hello`** and shown as such in the room.

## 2. The engine is the only judge

- The server holds no rules. Every legal move, every result and every bot or boss reply comes from `abalone-wasm` (`Engine` and `Encounter`), which wraps `abalone-core`.
- The agent never sends a state. It sends a move. The server asks the engine to play it. If the engine says no, the state does not change and the tool returns the engine's reason.
- `legal_moves` is the list the engine returns. A move that is not in it is illegal, whatever the agent believes.
- Online, the server also checks every move it receives with the engine (rules.md section 10.2, tech.md section 6). A peer that sends an illegal move is dropped.
- Resign is the one thing the engine does not model (rules.md OPEN-12). See `resign` in section 5.

## 3. Notation

### 3.1 Cells and moves

Same notation as `abalone-cli` (`parse_move` in `crates/abalone-cli/src/lib.rs`) and rules.md section 1.

- A cell is `(q,r)`, no space, for example `(-3,2)`. The board has 61 cells with `max(|q|,|r|,|q+r|) <= 4`.
- A move is the selected cells, then `>`, then the direction: `(-1,2)(0,2)>E`. One marble: `(0,0)>SE`.
- Directions: `E`, `W`, `NE`, `SW`, `NW`, `SE`. Upper case only.
- Cell order inside a move is kept as written.
- Parse errors reuse the `ParseError` messages of `abalone-cli`: `empty input`, `missing '>' before the direction`, `no cell before '>'`, `cell must look like (q,r), for example (0,0)`, `direction must be E, W, NE, SW, NW or SE`.

### 3.2 Bridge to the engine

`abalone-wasm` takes a move as 8 integers `[n, dir, q0, r0, q1, r1, q2, r2]` (`MOVE_STRIDE`). `n` is 1 to 3 marbles, unused coordinates are `0`. `dir` is the index in `E, W, NE, SW, NW, SE` (0 to 5). The MCP server converts between the string and this record at the edge. Nothing else converts.

### 3.3 Other codes

Use the codes of the `abalone-wasm` module doc, mapped to words in the tool output:

| Field | `abalone-wasm` code | MCP value |
|---|---|---|
| side (`to_move`) | `1`, `2` | `"black"`, `"white"` |
| status | `0` running, `1` Black won, `2` White won, `3` draw | `"running"`, `"black_won"`, `"white_won"`, `"draw"` |
| draw reason | `0` none, `1` repetition, `2` no ejection cap | `null`, `"repetition"`, `"no_ejection_cap"` |
| boss result (`result`) | `0` playing, `1` won, `2` lost | `"playing"`, `"won"`, `"lost"` |

A draw against a boss is a loss (rules.md section 10.3).

## 4. State

### 4.1 Who plays what

- Against the bot or a boss, the agent is Black and moves first. The bot or boss is White (same as `Encounter`).
- Online, the seat comes from the room (section 7).
- `play_move` plays the agent's move, then the bot or boss reply in the same call, so `get_state` always shows a position where the agent is to move, or a finished game.

### 4.2 `get_state` output

```json
{
  "game_id": "string",
  "mode": "bot | boss | online",
  "you": "black | white",
  "to_move": "black | white",
  "status": "running | black_won | white_won | draw",
  "draw_reason": "null | repetition | no_ejection_cap",
  "resigned": false,
  "ejected": { "black": 0, "white": 0 },
  "win_ejections": { "black": 6, "white": 6 },
  "ascii": "string",
  "board": "string",
  "last_moves": ["(0,0)>SE"],
  "boss": null
}
```

- `ejected` is `Engine.ejected(side)`: marbles that side has pushed out. `win_ejections` is `Engine.win_ejections(side)`.
- `ascii` is the board as printed by `render` in `abalone-cli`: header `  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`, rows `a` to `i`, `B`, `W`, `.`. On a radius 5 board (The Ballast Mind), `ascii` has header `  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A` and 11 rows `a` to `k` (`r = -5` to `5`).
- `board` is the cells in `Engine.board()` order, one character per cell: row by row from `r = -4` to `r = 4`, `q` ascending inside a row (61 cells). On a radius 5 board (The Ballast Mind), `board` has 91 characters: the 61 of the standard board first, then ring 5 in board order (rows from `r = -5` to `5`, `q` ascending). The Dual Room's board has 169: the same 91, then rings 6 and 7 in turn, each row by row; every cell off its two rooms is `x` (the void's row `r = 0` too, until the bridge's 5 cells turn `.` in P3), and `ascii` shows it with columns `0` to `E` and rows `a` to `o`. `.` empty, `B` Black, `W` White, `x` vanished (`3` in the engine), `c` a core and `O` the Overseer (The Overseer).
- `last_moves` is the last 6 plies in the notation of section 3.1, oldest first, boss and bot moves included.
- `resigned` is `true` after `resign`. It is the only field the engine does not own.

### 4.3 Boss state (phase and tell)

`boss` is `null` unless `mode` is `boss`. Otherwise it is one generic object, the same shape for every boss. No tool and no field is named after a boss: what a boss does shows up as data in `tell` and `marks`, so a new boss needs no change to the tool list or the schema.

```json
{
  "id": "string, one of boss_ids()",
  "name": "string",
  "phase": 0,
  "phases": 4,
  "tell": { "kind": "string", "cells": ["(q,r)"], "text": "string" },
  "marks": [{ "kind": "string", "cell": "(q,r)", "value": 2 }],
  "result": "playing | won | lost"
}
```

| Field | Engine source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id`, `name` | `boss_ids()`, `Encounter.name()` | `id` is one of `boss_ids()` |
| `phase`, `phases` | `Encounter.phase()`, `Encounter.phases()` | `0` is P1. It rises when the boss marble count drops under a threshold (rules.md section 10.3) |
| `tell` | `Encounter.tell()` and the boss's own getters | What the boss will do right after the next ply, shown one ply early. `null` when there is none. `kind` is a short stable id, `cells` the cells it touches, `text` a one-line description for the agent |
| `marks` | the boss's own getters | Cells the boss marked on the board, each with a `kind` and an optional number `value` |
| `result` | `Encounter.result()` | Fight result. A draw is a loss |

How the engine's per-boss getters map into the generic shape (the server does this, an agent never sees the getter names):

| Boss data in the engine | Shows up as |
|---|---|
| `Encounter.next_army()` | `tell` with `kind: "next_army"`, the marbles of that army in `cells` and the army in `text` |
| `Encounter.flips()` | `tell` with `kind: "flip"` and the cells that flip if nothing moves |
| `Encounter.pulsar()` | `tell` with `kind: "pulse"`, no cells, and the way the next pulse pushes, the player turns left before it and its force in `text` (The Pulsar) |
| `Encounter.charges()` | `marks` with `kind: "charge"` and `value` = the marble's charges (The Unstable Core: a marble weighs 1 + its charges in a push) |
| `Encounter.unstable()` | `tell` with `kind: "core"`, no cells, and the next event (collapse, shockwave) in `text` (The Unstable Core) |
| `Encounter.dual()` | `marks` with `kind: "return"` on the announced landing cell and `value` = the side of the coming marble; `tell` with `kind: "return"` and that cell while a marble is coming, else `kind: "bridge"`, no cells, the void or the bridge in `text` (The Dual Room: its board is 169 cells, the radius 7 scan of its two rooms) |
| `Encounter.cracks()` | `marks` with `kind: "crack"` and `value` = plies left |
| `Encounter.eggs()` | `marks` with `kind: "egg"` and `value` = player turns left before it hatches (The Alien) |
| `Encounter.trains()` | `marks` with `kind: "train"` on every cell of the train's line, from its entry, and `value` = player turns left before it passes (The Rail Yard) |
| `Encounter.polarities()` | `marks` with `kind: "polarity"` and `value` = `1` for +, `-1` for − (The Magnetizer) |
| `Encounter.incinerators()` | `marks` with `kind: "incinerator"` (The Overseer); its cores are `c` and the Overseer `O` on the board |
| `Encounter.turns_left()` (`-1` is no clock) | `tell` with `kind: "neurotoxin"` and the player turns left in `text` (The Overseer) |
| `Encounter.ballast_next()` (`-1` is none) | `tell` with `kind: "borrowed"` and the effect The Ballast Mind borrows at the end of this turn in `text` (the Hull's crack, the Pulsar's pulse, the Magnetizer's polarity, the Chaplain's conversion check) |
| `Encounter.belts()` | `marks` with `kind: "belt"` on every cell of a running belt and `value` = `1` toward +q, `-1` toward -q; `kind: "strike"` on the cell of an announced strike slot; and `tell` with `kind: "belt_reverse"` and the player turns left before the centre belt reverses in `text` (The Assembly Line) |
| `Encounter.swarm()` | `marks` with `kind: "arrival"` on each cell where a swarm marble lands after the player's move; `tell` with `kind: "arrival"`, those cells, and the boss turns before the evac and a pass in `text` (The Swarm) |
| `Encounter.converted()` | `marks` with `kind: "converted"` |
| `Encounter.armies()` | `marks` with `kind: "army"` and `value` = `0` Alto, `1` Tenor, `2` Bass |
| `Encounter.tell()` id (`-1` is none, `0` is an id: the end of a player turn) | `tell.kind` = `"special"` when no more specific kind applies, the id in `text` |

Rules for the generic shape:

- When several `tell` rows apply, the first one in the table wins: `next_army`, then `flip`, then `pulse`, then `neurotoxin`, then `borrowed`, then `special`.
- An unknown `kind` is not an error: an agent that does not know it ignores it and still plays legally. The tell is information, not a rule.
- `kind` values are stable once published. A new boss may add kinds, never rename one.
- The Ballast Mind's pillars show as `x` in `board`. The win threshold is read from `win_ejections` in `get_state`, never hard-coded. A `win_ejections` of `0` means that side does not win by ejections (the agent against The Swarm survives 30 turns instead).

## 5. Tools

All tools return JSON as MCP text content. A failure sets `isError: true` with an error object (section 6). The server keeps one game at a time.

### `new_game`

Starts a local game and drops any game in progress.

Input:

```json
{
  "boss": "string, optional, one of boss_ids()",
  "seed": "integer 0 to 4294967295, optional, default 0",
  "bot_nodes": "integer 1 to 200000, optional, default 20000"
}
```

- No `boss`: a game against the bot, mode `bot`. The bot searches at most `bot_nodes` positions per move (`Engine.best_move(nodes)`). 20000 is `BOT_NODES` in `client/src/bot.ts`.
- With `boss`: mode `boss`, `Encounter.new(boss, seed)`. The same id and seed always give the same fight. `bot_nodes` is ignored, the boss uses its own budget.

Output: the `get_state` object.

Errors: `unknown_boss`.

### `get_state`

Input: none. Output: the object of section 4.2. Errors: `no_game`.

### `legal_moves`

Input: none.

Output:

```json
{ "to_move": "black | white", "moves": ["(0,0)>SE", "..."], "announces": {}, "free": [], "count": 0 }
```

- `moves` is `Engine.legal_moves()` (or `Encounter.legal_moves()`) in notation. Empty once the game is over.
- On a boss turn that restricts the moves (for example the army in turn), the list only holds the allowed moves. Nothing else changes.
- `announces` is an object from a move to the reply the boss announces for it (`Encounter.tell_move(mv)`): for The Echo, the first bonus move that move gives it, a move with no bonus is left out (#859). It is empty unless the boss announces replies. Same shape for every boss, no per-boss output type.
- `free` is the free moves The Echo offers the agent now (`Encounter.free_moves()`, #958), also in `moves`. Playing one keeps the agent to move (no reply); playing any other move declines them all. Empty against the bot, the other bosses and online.

Errors: `no_game`.

### `play_move`

Input:

```json
{ "move": "(-1,2)(0,2)>E" }
```

Behaviour:

1. Parse the string (section 3.1). On failure: `bad_move`.
2. Convert to a record and call `play`. The engine rejects an illegal move: `illegal_move`, state unchanged.
3. If the game is still running and it is the bot's or boss's turn (not after one of The Echo's free moves), play its reply (`Engine.best_move(bot_nodes)` or `Encounter.boss_move()`) and apply it with `play`.

Output:

```json
{
  "played": "(-1,2)(0,2)>E",
  "reply": "(1,-2)>SW",
  "bonuses": [],
  "state": { "...": "the get_state object" }
}
```

`reply` is `null` when the game ended on the agent's move or the move was one of The Echo's free moves. `bonuses` lists the bonus plies The Echo's rule played after the agent's move, in order (`Encounter.last_bonuses()`, #859), empty otherwise: the agent's own bonus is offered in `legal_moves.free`, never played for it (#958). Online, `reply` is always `null`: use `wait_for_opponent_move` (section 7).

Errors: `no_game`, `game_over`, `not_your_turn`, `bad_move`, `illegal_move`.

### `create_room`

Online. Opens a room and takes a seat. Drops any game in progress. See section 7.

Input: none. The `Hello` has no name field, so a room shows no display name: the seat shows as an agent (section 8).

Output:

```json
{
  "room": "string, random 8+ characters (tech.md section 6)",
  "invite": "string, link a human opens in the client",
  "you": "black",
  "pub": "string, base64url Ed25519 public key of the agent"
}
```

The game starts when a second peer joins and both `Hello` are verified. `room` is `newRoomId` and `invite` is `inviteUrl` of `client/src/invite.ts`, on the live site. Errors: `already_in_room`, `transport_failed`.

### `join_room`

Online. Joins a room made by a human or by another agent.

Input:

```json
{ "room": "string, a room code or an invite link" }
```

Output: same shape as `create_room`, with `you` set to the seat the room gave (`white` if Black is taken). The call returns once the creator's `Hello` gave the agent its seat. A failed join keeps the game in progress. Errors: `already_in_room`, `room_full` (both seats taken, the agent would be a spectator and the server does not support spectating), `room_not_found` (no peer answered within the connect timeout, `SIGNALING_TIMEOUT_MS` of `client/src/netcounters.ts`, 30 s, the only creator runs another engine version (tech.md section 9), or the input holds no room code), `transport_failed`.

### `wait_for_opponent_move`

Online. Blocks until something happens. It never hangs: it returns at `timeout_s`.

Input:

```json
{ "timeout_s": "integer 1 to 120, optional, default 30" }
```

Output:

```json
{
  "event": "opponent_moved | game_over | opponent_left | desync | timeout",
  "move": "(1,-2)>SW",
  "state": { "...": "the get_state object" }
}
```

- `move` is set only for `opponent_moved`. It is `null` when nobody moved yet: the room creator's first call returns once the opponent has taken its seat.
- `opponent_moved` means it is the agent's turn and its opponent is connected: `play_move` can go.
- `opponent_left`: the data channel closed. Seats are kept for 60 s (rules.md section 10.2). The agent may call the tool again. Reported once per leave.
- `desync`: the opponent sent a move the agent refused, one that shows its log or position is not ours (`bad-chain`, `out-of-order`, `illegal` or `not-their-turn`, the desync reports of tech.md section 10, until moves carry a state hash). The move is not played, so the opponent stays to move: the game is paused (rules.md section 10.2). `get_state` still works. Reported once per refused move.
- If it is already the agent's turn, the call returns at once with `event: "opponent_moved"` and the last move.
- When several apply, the first of `desync`, `game_over`, `opponent_left`, `opponent_moved` wins.

Errors: `no_room`.

### `resign`

Input: none.

- **Local game or boss:** marks the game as resigned. `status` becomes the opponent's win (`white_won`), a boss `result` becomes `lost`, `resigned` is `true`. The engine is not asked, since it has no resign.
- **Online:** returns `not_supported`. Resign is rules.md OPEN-12 and an online resign needs a new signed message, so it waits for an owner decision. No tool path fakes it.

Output: the `get_state` object. Errors: `no_game`, `game_over`, `not_supported`.

## 6. Errors

An error is `{ "code": "...", "message": "..." }`. `message` is the engine's reason or the `ParseError` text when there is one.

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `no_game` | No game started (`new_game` or a room first) |
| `unknown_boss` | `boss` is not in `boss_ids()` |
| `bad_move` | The string does not parse. `message` is the `ParseError` text |
| `illegal_move` | The engine refused the move. `message` is the engine error (`Game::play` error, Debug format) |
| `game_over` | The game has ended |
| `not_your_turn` | Online, it is the opponent's turn |
| `no_room`, `already_in_room`, `room_full`, `room_not_found` | Room state |
| `transport_failed` | The P2P layer could not start |
| `not_supported` | Online resign |

## 7. Online rooms

- The server runs the same P2P stack as the browser client, in Node: Trystero with a WebRTC polyfill, behind the `Transport` interface of `client/src/transport.ts`. Signaling carries only SDP and ICE. Game data goes over the data channel (tech.md section 6).
- The agent signs every move as a `MoveRecord` `{game, seq, prev, move, pub, sig}` (`client/src/moverecord.ts`). `move` is the 8-integer record of section 3.2. The hash chain is the same as for humans.
- Seats come from `Hello` `{kind, game, seat, roster, pub, sig}`. The agent's key is created per process and kept in memory. The creator's `Hello` carries the roster.
- The session is `OnlineSession` of `client/src/session.ts`, the browser client's own, with `agent: true`. The transport is `p2pTransport` of `client/src/p2p.ts`, so the app id and the rooms are the client's: a human joins with the invite link. In Node, [werift](https://github.com/shinyoshiaki/werift-webrtc) (pure TypeScript, the polyfill the Trystero README names) is the global `RTCPeerConnection`.
- The agent checks every move it receives with `Engine.play`, and every signature. A move it refuses is not played, as in the browser client.
- Rooms have two seats. A third peer is refused as a player (bug #117).
- Rematch (tech.md section 6) is not exposed in v1. The agent starts a new room.
- No TURN in v1 (multiplayer.md section 4). A pair behind a symmetric NAT cannot connect, and `join_room` returns `room_not_found` or `transport_failed`.

## 8. Agent flag in `Hello`

Add one field to `Hello`:

```ts
interface Hello {
  kind: 'hello';
  game: string;
  seat: number;
  roster: string[];
  agent?: true;   // present only for an agent
  pub: string;
  sig: string;
}
```

- The field is part of what is signed (`helloPayload` in `client/src/moverecord.ts`), so nobody can add or remove it in transit.
- A `Hello` without `agent` means a human. Old clients keep working.
- The room shows an "agent" mark next to the seat. The mark does not change the rules.
- The MCP server always sets it. A human client never does.
- The flag is a label, not proof. A human can run a client that lies. That is accepted: the point is that honest agents are visible.

## 9. Follow-up tasks (parent #163)

Order: local game against the bot and bosses first, online rooms second, agent flag third.

1. [#252](https://github.com/TidyMaze/ab-alone/issues/252) Task: MCP server, local game against the bot (`new_game`, `get_state`, `legal_moves`, `play_move`, `resign`)
2. [#253](https://github.com/TidyMaze/ab-alone/issues/253) Task: MCP bosses in `new_game`, with phase and tell in `get_state`
3. [#254](https://github.com/TidyMaze/ab-alone/issues/254) Task: MCP online rooms (`create_room`, `join_room`, `wait_for_opponent_move`)
4. [#255](https://github.com/TidyMaze/ab-alone/issues/255) Task: agent flag in the signed `Hello`, shown in the room

#254 must not ship before #255, or an agent seat shows as a human.

## 10. Open items for the owners

- Online resign needs a decision (rules.md OPEN-12) and a signed message. Not decided here.
- The server code lives in the `mcp/` package (#252): bun, the official TypeScript MCP SDK, the Node build of `abalone-wasm`. How to run it: README, "Let an AI agent play".
- Spectating is not part of v1.
