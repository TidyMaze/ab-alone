# Open world terrain (#962, tasks #983, #984, #987, #988)

One topic: how the generated map of the Open world gets large landmarks and fine detail, regions with
their own look, a taller relief and an easier walk. It builds on `openworld.md` section 2 (the map) and
changes no rule of Abalone (`rules.md`). Owner requests of 2026-10-30: "ajoute des biomes / variations dans
la map, procedural toujours, plusieurs niveaux de cartes de terrain pour avoir du detail micro et macro",
"diminue le nombre d'obstacles/arbres, le deplacement est souvent difficile", "augmente le relief".

Four tasks change the same lines and every world of every seed, so they go **one after the other**
(section 7). Each pins the world with the digest test of #981 and updates its value on purpose.

## 1. Today

- `cell(seed, q, r)` in `crates/edgefall-core/src/world.rs`: height 0 to 3 from
  `0.65 * noise(.., 12) + 0.35 * noise(.., 5)` (thresholds 0.32, 0.50, 0.64), a `dry` noise (scale 9) picks sand
  or rock over grass, forests are `noise(.., 7) > 0.55` and half their grass is a tree, a boulder stands on
  6 % of the open cells, a wall segment per 24-cell square. `noise` is value noise with a smooth blend
  between the corners of a lattice of `scale` cells.
- The chunk bytes are 2 per cell: height, terrain code. The client column is `topOf = 0.2 + 0.2 * height`.
- Seen from afar the map is fine static: one scale everywhere, no landmark.

## 2. Levels of noise (#983)

A **field** is a weighted sum of value noise at three scales, each from the seed, its own salt and the cell,
so any order of visit gives the same world:

| Level | Scale (cells) | Gives |
|---|---|---|
| macro | 128 | continents and seas, climate regions |
| meso | 40 | ranges, big lakes, plateaus, forest patches |
| micro | 8 | local bumps, ragged borders |

- `field(seed, salt, q, r, weights)` replaces the one-off `noise` calls: `w_macro * noise(.., 128) +
  w_meso * noise(.., 40) + w_micro * noise(.., 8)`, weights summing to 1. First values: height 0.50, 0.35,
  0.15; moisture 0.45, 0.35, 0.20; temperature 0.55, 0.30, 0.15 (section 4). The salts are 30 and up (the
  enemy draws use 12 to 21); the existing ones keep their meaning until their code is replaced.
- **Scale**: the widest zoom sees about 21 chunks (about 340 cells) across, so the macro level must repeat well
  inside that: at 256 cells one feature filled the view and the far view read as a plain (measured in #983).
- **Spawn land**: the macro level of the elevation is offset per seed by one of 16 offsets (up to 4096 cells,
  searched once per seed): the first whose cells (the spawn, the corners of the ring of radius 4, twelve cells on
  radius 8 and twelve on radius 32) are all land, heights 2 to 6, else the one with fewest that are not. No
  fade near the spawn: a fade widens the flat area the far view shows.
- Value noise of several levels bunches around 0.5, so **thresholds are measured, not guessed**: a test
  computes the histogram of a field over a window of chunks and the constants are the quantiles that give the
  target shares below. The constants carry a comment saying so.
- **Eight heights**, 0 to 7 (a `u8` already, `Cell.height`). Target share of the cells per level:
  8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 16, 12, 8 %. Levels 0 and 1 are water (18 %), 2 is a sandy shore, 3 and 4 are the biome's
  low ground, 5 and 6 the uplands (rock), 7 is a peak (8 %, blocked). Peaks and water are the large
  obstacles, so the macro and meso levels must make them come in masses, not in dust.
- **Cost**: each lattice node is hashed once per chunk and each cell interpolates from the chunk's tables, as
  #981 did for the old noise. Budget: one chunk at most 20 us native, the 4096 chunks at most 3 times the
  figure #981 reports (about 27 ms), measured in the PR with the timing example that #981 adds (`crates/edgefall-core/examples/world_timing.rs`).
- **Client**: until #988 the visible column must not change, so `topOf` maps the eight levels onto today's
  scale (`0.2 + 0.2 * level * 3 / 7`) in #983. #988 replaces it.

## 3. Fewer obstacles (#987)

Smallest task, first in the order. Only constants of `cell`:

- A forest cell is a tree one time in four (`unit(.., 6) < 0.25`, was 0.5).
- Boulders: 20 per mille of the open cells (`BOULDER_PER_MILLE = 20`, was 60).
- Water, peaks and walls unchanged.
- **Test**: in the 5 x 5 chunks around the spawn, for 8 seeds, a flood fill over the six neighbours from the
  spawn reaches at least 90 % of the open cells, and the blocked share is under the old bound; the existing
  share test is tightened to the measured figures (blocked 10 to 35 %, boulders at most 2 %).
- `openworld.md` section 2 states "about 6 %" and "about half": updated in the same PR (or in the pending
  spec PR #969 if it is still open).

## 4. Biomes (#984, six sextants since #1442)

A biome is a region with its own ground, trees and boulders. Since #1442 (owner, 2026-11-02: "6 biomes, one per zone of the
hexagon") the biome of a cell is the **sextant** of the hexagon it lies in, seen from the spawn: the six wedges of 60 degrees
centred on the six axial directions, each running out to a corner of the world. Before, a temperature and a moisture field
mixed five climate biomes everywhere (#984), so every direction looked alike.

| Sextant (axial direction) | Biome | Ground tint | Tree | Boulder (per mille) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| East `(1, 0)`, the start | Meadow | green | 2 % | 15 |
| North-east `(1, -1)` | Forest | deep green | 25 % | 15 |
| North-west `(0, -1)` | Tundra | snow white | 4 % | 25 |
| West `(-1, 0)` | Desert | warm sand | none | 30 |
| South-west `(-1, 1)` | Badlands | dark red rock | none | 45 |
| South-east `(0, 1)` | Archipelago (new) | fresh green `#5c7d58` | 5 % | 10 |

- **Ragged borders**: the angle of a cell round the spawn (the pointy-top layout of the client: x along `q`, the north is `-r`)
  is turned by `(border - 0.5) * 1.2` radians (`BORDER_TURN`), `border` a field of section 2 (macro, meso and micro levels, the
  salts of the old temperature), so a border is never a straight line and wanders further the further it runs from the spawn
  (some 10 degrees either way).
- **Blend**: each cell is moved again by a draw of up to 3 cells either way (`BLEND`) when its biome is picked, so two biomes
  mix over a few cells along their border.
- **Spawn**: the clearing (radius 3) is Meadow grass at height 3. Around it a soft Meadow bias (#1024): a cell is Meadow when a
  draw of its own falls below the bias, full within 8 cells of the spawn and falling by a smoothstep to nothing at 16. So the
  disc of axial radius 10 is Meadow on at least 80 % of its cells, on seeds 1 to 16.
- **Archipelago**: mostly water, with islands of sand and low grass, crossed by boat (#1441). Its elevation is that of the meso
  and micro levels only (no continent), lowered by `SEA_DROP` 0.19, and its tops are cut at `ISLAND_TOP` (height 4): no rock, no
  peak. The sea comes in smoothly, by a smoothstep over the 3 cells of the blend inside its border and from 40 to 90 cells out
  of the spawn, so the land round the spawn (section 2's ring) is kept. Its middle 20 degrees, from 120 cells out, is 65 to 85 %
  water over seeds 1 to 4.
- **What a biome changes**: the ground tint of the low ground (levels 3 and 4) in the 3D view, the minimap and the map, and the
  density of the obstacles per open cell on the low ground. Elsewhere water, shore (level 2), uplands and peaks keep their
  terrain in every biome; the archipelago alone also changes the relief, as above.
- **No new `Terrain`**: the tint is a colour, not a terrain. The ground and the props are tinted per instance,
  `LOOK[ground] x BIOME_TINT[biome]` (`setColorAt`), so no new mesh. The map paints a low grass cell in the same ground.
- **Chunk bytes**: 3 per cell, `height, terrain, biome` (the biome code is the order of the `Biome` enum: `0` meadow to
  `5` archipelago, `u8`). Enemies stand on the open land of every biome, never on water.
- **Lairs and teleporters** (`openworld.md` sections 7 and 10): lair cell `k` (the draw's number; the boss on it is by tier since #1532, section 15) is drawn in the sextant `k % 6` and kept only on the
  open ground of its biome, so each biome holds two lairs or more (15 bosses: three in the meadow, the forest and the tundra, two
  in the others). The teleporters keep their squares; an archipelago square with no island that fits has none (seed 7 holds 34,
  36 before, and seed 1305 36, 37 before; at least four in every biome).
- **Tests**: each sextant's middle 20 degrees is its biome (95 % of the cells, seeds 1 to 4); a border is ragged and blends;
  the archipelago is mostly water with islands of sand and grass, no rock nor peak; the obstacle densities of each biome hold on
  the low ground (trees within a fifth, boulders within a third); enemies, two lairs and a teleporter in every biome; the spawn
  clearing is Meadow and open; the order of visit does not matter. The eight-height shares and the far view's sea and range are
  measured out of the archipelago, whose sea is meant; the blocked share and the 32-seed flood fill of #987 still hold.
  `WORLD_VERSION` is 4 since #1442 (3 for the hexagon of #1440).

**Measured (#1442)**, the 16 x 16 chunks around the spawn, seeds 1 to 4. Share of the window per biome: meadow 15.3 %, forest
11.8 %, tundra 16.6 %, desert 21.3 %, badlands 12.7 %, archipelago 22.2 %. Low ground obstacles: meadow trees 2.0 % and 16.4
boulders per mille, forest 25.1 % and 10.6, tundra 4.1 % and 26.4, desert 0 % and 28.5, badlands 0 % and 45.0, archipelago
4.8 % and 8.6. Blocked share 36.3 % (bound 26 to 37), water 26.5 %. The middle of the archipelago is 64.9, 76.3, 88.0 and 66.5 %
water on seeds 1 to 4.

**Digest**: the world digest moves to 16742511850258042212 (`WORLD_VERSION` 4).

**Cost** (`world_timing`, the minimum of three runs on a shared machine): the 2465 chunks of the hexagon 30.1 ms before and
39.8 ms after (budget 117 ms): two angles and two draws more per cell.

**Memory**: unchanged, the tint is the instance colour every ground and prop already carries (#984).

## 5. Relief (#988)

Client only, after #983 (it needs the eight heights).

- `topOf(level) = 0.2 + STEP * level`, water at 0.08. **`STEP = 0.5`** (a peak at 3.7), kept on screenshots of
  seed 7 at STEP 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, closest and widest: 0.3 reads flat (the cliff faces are thin), 0.4 shows short
  faces, 0.5 shows the rock plateaus and the peak cluster standing clear of the grass with tall side faces, and no
  cell hidden behind a peak at close zoom. Props, marbles and the troop stand on `topOf`; the mountains (1.2 to 2.0
  high) read as spires on the taller columns, so their scale is unchanged.
- **Finding**: on seed 7 no two passable cells differ by 2 levels or more within 45 cells of the spawn: the steepest
  step a hero can walk is one level. The tall faces are peaks (blocked, level 7) against rock (level 6), 22 cells out
  at (-8, 22) and (-8, 23). The e2e test steps onto a cell one level up, (4, 0).
- **Camera**: it follows the hero's column top with an ease, `y += (target - y) * (1 - exp(-dt / 0.12))`, so a
  step up or down a cliff does not jump. A gap within 0.01 snaps; reduced motion jumps at once. The mode draws
  every frame of the ease and none after it settles. At STEP 0.5 a 3-level step (a gap of 1.5) is 0.010 from the top
  after 0.6 s, on the top within 0.67 s.
- **Pick**: a click is the nearest hit of the ray among the hero's cell and its six neighbours, each tested
  against its own top plane `y = topOf(cell)` and kept only if the hit point lies in that cell (`cellAtPoint` of the
  hit is the candidate). No hit, no move: the hero's own cell comes back and the roll does nothing. A lower cell
  hidden behind a higher ring cell cannot be clicked at its top centre: the test covers all six neighbours above the
  ring's level and the two in front below it.
- **Cost**: the build is unchanged: a rebuild at the widest zoom takes a median 38.6 ms on main and 38.8 ms with this
  task (35 rebuilds each, in node, a synthetic world of every terrain and height).
- Cost: no per-frame work added; a rebuild does not get slower.

## 6. Shared rules

- **Order independence and determinism**: a chunk comes from the seed and its coordinates alone.
- **Spawn**: radius 3 open grass, reachable, no enemy within 8 (`openworld.md` section 2).
- **World version**: each task changes every world. Once the save of #968 stores a seed, it also stores a
  `WORLD_VERSION` (a constant bumped by each terrain task), so an old save is told apart, not misread.
  As built (#968): `WORLD_VERSION` is in `crates/edgefall-core/src/world.rs`, with a comment above it (`1` until #1024,
  `2` until #1440, `3` since). The digest test asserts `(WORLD_VERSION, world_digest())` against `(3, <digest>)` on one line, so a change of the generator forces an edit
  of that line: bump the version and repin the digest in the same commit. The bridge exports it as `world_version()`
  (`crates/edgefall-wasm/src/world.rs`), and the client saves it with each world (`openworld.md` section 5): a save of another
  version is not loaded.
- **Memory and speed** follow #981: bounded chunk caches (512 chunks, radius 10), no per-frame allocation, a
  rebuild under about 40 ms at the widest zoom.

## 7. Order of work and conflicts

One task at a time, each branched from `main` after the previous merged (CONTRIBUTING rules 15 and 16):

| Order | Task | Lines it touches |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | #987 fewer obstacles | the constants of `cell`, `world.rs` tests, the digest |
| 2 | #983 noise levels, eight heights | `cell` (the elevation and thresholds), a `field` helper, `topOf` mapping, the digest |
| 3 | #988 relief | `topOf`, `pick`, the camera follow in `openworldview.ts`; no engine file |
| 4 | #984 biomes | `cell`, the chunk bytes (`world.rs`, `edgefall-wasm/src/world.rs`, `parseChunk`, `Tile`), instance colours in `OpenWorldView.build` |

#988 can run beside #983 only if it waits for the eight heights, so it is kept after it. Nothing here runs
beside the zoom group (#976 to #981) while that group is open: it touches `openworldview.ts` and `world.rs`.

## 8. Open choices

- **Biome tint per instance colour** (recommended) or one mesh per ground and biome (more draw calls).
- **Biome as a third byte** (recommended, simple) or packed in the terrain byte (less memory, harder to read).
- **Rivers, swamps and more biomes**: not now; each needs its own task once these four are in.
